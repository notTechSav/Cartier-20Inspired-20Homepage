# âœ¨ Simple AI Setup (No Gateway Bloat!)

## What You Actually Need

Forget the AI Gateway complexity. Here's the lean, clean setup:

### 1. Install AI SDK
```bash
pnpm install ai @ai-sdk/openai
```

### 2. Add Your OpenAI Key
```env
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### 3. Create Simple Helper (Optional)
```typescript
// lib/ai.ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

export const models = {
  gpt4oMini: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
  gpt4o: openai('gpt-4o'),
  gpt35Turbo: openai('gpt-3.5-turbo'),
};
```

### 4. Use It Anywhere
```typescript
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { models } from './lib/ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: models.gpt4oMini,
  prompt: 'Hello!',
});

console.log(result.text);
```

## That's It! 

No gateway, no bloat, just clean AI integration. ðŸŽ‰

## Track Spending (Simple Way)

Just check OpenAI's dashboard:
https://platform.openai.com/usage

It shows:
- How much you spent
- How many requests
- Which models you used

Same info, simpler! ðŸ“Š

## When You Might Need AI Gateway Later

Only if you:
- Have a huge team tracking AI usage
- Need detailed per-feature cost breakdown
- Want to enforce rate limits per user
- Are spending $1000+/month on AI

For learning/small projects? **You don't need it!** âœ…
