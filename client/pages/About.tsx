              A client once sent two lines: in-suite only, three hours, no
              celebrity talk. Most people would see red flags. I saw the
              date—Gateway Conference, same week last year at the Four Seasons.
              I saw the precision—three hours meant no dinner break. I saw the
              subtext—he’d had a bad experience and wanted efficiency, privacy,
              and a conversation with substance. I arrived discreetly at seven,
              no instructions needed. That’s what institutional memory looks
              like when it’s in practice.

              My work sits at the intersection of strategic counsel and personal
              continuity. Half of what I do is high-level thinking—pattern
              recognition, operational clarity, risk sorting. The other half is
              presence—listening until I can hear the sentence you didn’t
              finish. The outcome is relief: you don’t have to explain yourself
              to be understood.
            </p>

              I keep a small roster so every relationship stays alive in my
              head. Each engagement builds on the last; by the third, we’re
              operating at full depth. Decisions move faster, and the
              conversations reach a level most people never get to have.
            </p>
            <p>
              I work with C-suite executives, IPO founders, and family-office
              principals who already have brilliant advisors but no one who
              remembers the whole picture—the professional, the personal, and
              the quiet space in between. That’s the gap I fill.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t advertise availability because capacity is limited by
              design. When I reach twenty active partnerships, I raise rates
              rather than add more names. If continuity matters to you, reach
              out before the next review window.
